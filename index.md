# BYOA - Codable
In this project, you will use your knowledge of Swift and Networking to build an app from an API of your choosing! Building apps on your own will not only strengthen your skills, but also allow you better learn your limits.

Students who complete this project independently or as a pairing will showcase their understanding of the following principles:

* Basic Storyboard constraints
* UITableviews
* Creating Custom `class` objects
* Constants, Variables, and Basic Data Types
* Collections
* Functions
* Control Flow
* IBActions && IBOutlets
* API Calls
* API Documentation
---

##  Before you begin
Please `Fork` then `clone` the repo. You can access the repo here:
[GitHub - Stateful-Academy/BYOA_Codable](https://github.com/Stateful-Academy/BYOA_Codable)

Create a local branch named `starter` 
---

## Requirements:
Your completes app must:
* Use `Codable` protocol to decode the data
* Use `Result Type` to handle the closures
* Hit at least `two` separate endpoints.
	* Data -> Image URL
	* Data -> Data
	* SearchedData -> Detailed Data

You got this!

## Design
The design of your app is entirely up to you! Do want to have a list view that displays the data? Maybe you want the user to have the option to navigate to a detail screen to see additional information? Its all up to you!

That said, we recommend reviewing the API docs for the API you choose and see what type of data youâ€™ll have access to. Let that be your guide when deciding how it should look.

Feel free to reference any past project for inspiration and syntax support.

## Choosing the API
Using the Public APIâ€™s list on GitHub browse the options available and choose the API that sounds best to you.
[GitHub - public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
A few things to remember when choosing an API:
* Is it free?
* What type of `Authorization` does it require?
* Does it return JSON ðŸ˜¨
* What does the URL look like?

Reach out to an Instructor for support on choosing the right API

## Forbidden APIS
The following APIâ€™s are forbidden to use. Why? They either use `OAUTH` which you have not learned yet, are apart of the course, or in our experience they do not lend themselves well to this type of project.

Please do not use any of the following APIs:
* Nasa
* DnD
* WeatherBit
* CoinGecko
* TMDB: The Movie Data Base
* Pokeapi
* Bungie Studios
* Whale Museum
* Shibe Online
